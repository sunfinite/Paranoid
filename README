Python compiler for Parrot

$paranoid sampleinputs/filename
#The .pir code is written to a file named 'output.pir'

$shell
#Shell simulation. Supports for, assignment and print statements.

Interoperability:
    -> perl: Executable wrapper to generate .pir from perl6 functions called from python programs. Removes the anonymous modifier from the .pir functions generated by perl6
    
    Eg:
        $perl perlsamples/python2perllist.pl python2perllist.pir
        #The naming of the .pir is important as it is import in the python code
        
        $paranoid sampleinputs/python2perllist.py
        #This works only if the parrot installation being used is the one made from 
        #the rakudo source. There is a problem loading perl6 libraries otherwise.
        
    -> perl2: Executable wrapper to generate .pir from perl6 programs which call python functions. Processes the importpython statement.

    Eg:
        $paranoid sampleinputs/perl2pythonlist.py perl2pythonlist.pir
    
        $perl2 perlsamples/perl2pythonlist.pl output.pir

        $parrot output.pir
