Python compiler for Parrot

paranoid sampleinputs/filename
#The .pir code is written to a file named 'output.pir'

Interoperability:
    -> perl: Executable wrapper to generate .pir from perl6 functions called from python programs. Removes the anonymous modifier from the .pir functions generated by perl6
    
    Eg:
        1. perl perlsamples/python2perllist.pl python2perllist.pir
        #The naming of the .pir is important as it is import in the python code
        
        2. paranoid sampleinputs/python2perllist.py
        #This works only if the parrot installation being used is the one made from 
        #the rakudo source. There is a problem loading perl6 libraries otherwise.
        
    -> perl2: Executable wrapper to generate .pir from perl6 programs which call python functions. Processes the importpython statement.

    Eg:
        1. paranoid sampleinputs/perl2pythonlist.py perl2pythonlist.pir
    
        2. perl2 perlsamples/perl2pythonlist.pl output.pir

        3. parrot output.pir
